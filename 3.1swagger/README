This project demonstrates the documentation created by Swagger.
It provides an overview of generating REST API documentation for Spring projects.

It requires a config file, which can be found under src > main > java > com.example > SwaggerConfig
For every API specification there should exist a bean in this file.

Additional information can be provided by adding different annotations before the REST API class
and individual resource methods.
The example can be seen in src > main > java > com.example > restdocs > RequestMappingDemoController

The documentation is generated at the following link: http://localhost:8080/api-docs/
It returns the API specification in JSON format.

But Swagger provides a UI library which is integrated in this project and the formatted documentation
can be seen at http://localhost:8080/
