This project demonstrates the documentation created by Spring RestDocs.
It provides an overview of generating REST API documentation for Spring projects.

There are two examples given in this project. These examples are primarily written in *.asciidoc
files. At compile time, these files are rendered into a formatted HTML file to be viewable in the
browser.

Spring Restdocs support test driven documentation and therefore all the documentation is generated
in the test classes. It also allows the developer to generate code snippets, which can be included
in the .asciidoc files (example of such inclusions can be seen in example 2).
