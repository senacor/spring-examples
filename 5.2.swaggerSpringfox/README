This project demonstrates the documentation created by Swagger 2.0 specification.
It provides an overview of generating REST API documentation for Spring projects using Springfox Swagger.

For every API specification there should exist a bean of type Docket in Application class.

Unlike typical Swagger documented projects, the Springfox Swagger does not require any annotation above the actual API.
The example can be seen in src > main > java > com.example > UserRestService where no Swagger
related annotation exists.

Springfox Swagger integrates the Swagger UI library and the documentation can be seen at
